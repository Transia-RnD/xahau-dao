# DAO Structure: A Comprehensive Guide

## Overview

The XLS structure is a comprehensive system designed to facilitate the development and implementation of ideas in the field of distributed ledger technology (DLT), specifically Xahau, Hooks, Rippled/Xrpld, and Github. The structure is divided into three main components: Ideas, Candidates, and Proposals. Each component plays a crucial role in the overall process, from the conception of an idea to its final implementation.

## Ideas (RFI/RFP)

Ideas form the foundation of the XLS structure. They are base-level concepts that require no technical understanding. They can either be a hook or an amendment, but it's likely that the user may not know the difference between the two.

## Ideas Flow

The flow of ideas in the XLS structure is a crucial part of the overall process. It is the initial stage where concepts are born and gradually refined into actionable proposals. The flow of ideas is divided into three main stages: Request for Information (RFI), Request for Proposal (RFP), and Request for Quotations (RFQ) for creating a proposal.

### Request for Information (RFI)

The RFI stage is the birthplace of ideas. At this stage, a user has a concept or a question that they believe could lead to an improvement or innovation in the field of distributed ledger technology (DLT). However, they may not have a clear understanding of the technical aspects or feasibility of their idea. 

The RFI is a call to the community for more information. It's a way for the user to gather insights, feedback, and potential challenges related to their idea. The community can provide technical details, potential use cases, and even potential pitfalls or challenges that the idea might face.

### Request for Proposal (RFP)

Once the idea has been refined through the RFI stage, it moves on to the RFP stage. At this point, the user has a clearer understanding of their idea and its potential impact. They are now actively seeking a candidate who can transform this idea into a detailed proposal.

The RFP is a call to the community for candidates who are capable of creating a proposal out of the idea. It's a way for the user to find individuals or teams with the necessary technical knowledge and skills to bring their idea to life. The RFP stage also includes a crowdfunding aspect, where community members can donate to support the creation of the proposal.

### Request for Quotations (RFQ)

The final stage in the flow of ideas is the RFQ stage. Once a candidate has been identified and the crowdfunding goal has been reached, the RFQ is issued. This is a call for the candidate to provide a detailed quotation for creating the proposal.

The quotation should include a breakdown of the work involved, the resources required, and an estimate of the cost. This allows the community to understand the scope of the proposal and the resources needed to implement it. Once the quotation is accepted, the candidate can start working on the proposal, marking the transition from the idea stage to the proposal stage.

### Idea Persona

The idea persona in the XLS structure is someone who has a concept or idea for improvement in the field of distributed ledger technology (DLT). They may lack technical understanding but are crucial for initiating the process by seeking information and feedback from the community. They are open to learning and refining their idea, serving as the spark that ignites innovation in the XLS structure.

## Candidates

Candidates are the driving force behind the transformation of ideas into tangible proposals and their eventual implementation. They are individuals or groups who are deeply involved in the source code or implementation of distributed ledger technology (DLT). They possess a strong understanding of Xahau, Rippled/Xrpld, DLT, and Hooks, which equips them with the necessary knowledge and skills to navigate the complexities of the field.

### Role of Candidates

Candidates play a pivotal role in the XLS structure. Their responsibilities include:

1. **Understanding and Evaluating Ideas:** Candidates are expected to understand the ideas presented in the RFI or RFP stage. They evaluate the feasibility, potential impact, and technical requirements of these ideas.

2. **Proposal Creation:** If an idea is deemed viable, candidates are responsible for creating a detailed proposal. This proposal outlines the technical approach, timeline, and resources required to bring the idea to life.

3. **Crowdfunding Support:** Once the proposal is created and deployed on the DAO, candidates may assist in promoting the proposal to attract crowdfunding support.

4. **Implementation:** If the proposal is successfully funded and approved by the governance, candidates are responsible for implementing the proposal. This involves writing the necessary code, testing its functionality, and making necessary adjustments based on feedback.

5. **Review and Refinement:** Candidates also play a role in the review process. They are expected to mark their work for review once significant progress has been made. They then refine their work based on the feedback received during the review process.

6. **Final Implementation:** Once the proposal is reviewed and approved, candidates merge the proposal, marking the final implementation of the idea.

### Candidate Persona

The candidate persona is someone with a strong understanding of Xahau, Rippled/Xrpld, DLT, and Hooks. They are technically proficient, detail-oriented, and capable of transforming abstract ideas into concrete solutions. They are also collaborative, ready to engage with the community for feedback and improvements.

## Proposals

Proposals are the next step in the XLS structure. Technically, anyone can take an idea and create a proposal out of it, or just create a proposal without first creating an idea. Proposals are first created in the XLS discussion, and then the Transia DAO is used to crowdfund the proposal.

### Proposal Persona

The proposal persona is an approved candidate who has the technical knowledge and skills to turn an idea into a proposal and eventually implement it.

### Proposal Flow

1. **Idea Creation (RFI or RFP):** The process begins with the creation of an idea, which can either be a Request for Information (RFI) or a Request for Proposal (RFP). An RFI is an idea that the user would like more information on, while an RFP is an idea that is actively looking for a candidate to write the proposal.

2. **XLS Github Proposal Creation:** Once the idea is fully formed and has been discussed, it is turned into a proposal. The proposal is first created on Github, where it is open for further discussion and refinement.

    - **Discussion and Refinement:** The proposal is discussed and refined based on feedback from the community. This is a crucial step to ensure that the proposal is feasible and beneficial.

3. **DAO Proposal Creation/Deployment:** After the proposal has been refined, it is then created and deployed on the DAO. This is where the crowdfunding of the proposal takes place.

    - **Crowdfunding:** The community can donate to the proposal. If the proposal reaches its funding goal before the expiration date, it moves on to the next step. If it doesn't reach its goal, the money is returned to the donors.

4. **Goal Reached & Request for Quotations (RFQ):** Once the funding goal is reached, an RFQ is issued. This is a call for developers or teams who can implement the proposal to submit their quotations.

    - **Quotation Submission:** Developers or teams submit their quotations, outlining how they plan to implement the proposal and how much it will cost.

5. **Governance Votes on Developer/Quote:** The governance then votes on the developer or quote. The developer or team with the most votes is chosen to implement the proposal.

    - **Initial Payout Disbursed:** Once a developer or team is chosen, the initial payout is disbursed. This is to ensure that the developer or team has the necessary resources to start working on the proposal.

6. **Developer Marks for Review:** After the developer or team has done a significant amount of work on the proposal, they mark it for review.

    - **Review, Review, Review:** The proposal is then reviewed multiple times to ensure that it is being implemented correctly and according to the initial proposal.

7. **Merged & Final Payouts Disbursed:** Once the proposal is reviewed and approved, it is merged. The final payouts are then disbursed to the developer or team.

    - **Final Review and Approval:** The proposal is given a final review and approval before it is merged. This is to ensure that the proposal has been implemented correctly and is ready to be launched.
    - **Final Payouts Disbursed:** After the proposal is merged, the final payouts are disbursed to the developer or team. This is the final step in the proposal flow.
