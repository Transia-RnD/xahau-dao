Unless otherwise provided herein, fifty-percent of the directors then in office (but in no case fewer than one-third of the fixed or prescribed number of directors provided for in these Bylaws) shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business except adjournment.

Section 5.12 – Fees and Compensation

Members of committees may receive such compensation, if any, for their services and such reimbursement for expenses as may be fixed or determined by resolution of the Board of Members (As Directors); provided that such compensation shall be reasonable and shall be comparable to that compensation paid by unaffiliated entities for a like position.  Nothing herein shall be considered to preclude any director from serving this corporation in any other capacity, including as an officer, agent, employee, consultant or otherwise, and receiving reasonable compensation therefor.

Section 5.13 – Indemnity

The corporation shall indemnify its directors to the fullest extent allowed or required by Sections 65.391 through 65.404 of the Act.

Section 5.14 – Standard of Conduct

Pursuant to Section 65.357 of the Act, a director shall discharge the duties of a director, including duties as a member of any committee of the Board upon which the director may serve, in good faith, with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances, and in a manner the director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation.  In discharging the duties of a director, a director shall be entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, in each case if prepared or presented by: (a) one or more officers or employees of this corporation whom the director reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented; (b) legal counsel, public accountants or other persons as to matters the director reasonably believes are within the person’s professional or expert competence; or (c) a committee of the Board of which the director is not a member, as to matters within the committee’s jurisdiction, if the director reasonably believes the committee merits confidence.  A director is not acting in good faith if the director has knowledge concerning the matter in question that makes reliance otherwise permitted in this Section 5.14 unwarranted.  A director is not liable to the corporation, any member or any other person for any action taken or not taken as a director, if the director acted in compliance with this Section 5.14.  The liability of a director for monetary damages to the corporation shall be eliminated to the fullest extent permitted by the Act.

Section 5.15 – Conflict of Interest Transactions

(a) Conflict of Interest.

As used in this section, a “conflict of interest transaction” is a transaction with the corporation in which a director of the corporation has a direct or indirect interest.  A director has an indirect interest in a transaction if (i) another entity in which the director has a material interest or in which the director is a general partner is a party to the transaction; (ii) if another entity of which the director is a director, officer or trustee is a party to the transaction and the transaction is or should be considered by the board of directors of the corporation;or (iii) a person who is related to the director or a business associate of the director is a party to the transaction.
(b) Approval.

A conflict of interest transaction is not voidable or the basis for imposing liability on the director if the transaction is fair to the corporation at the time it was entered into or is approved either (I) in advance by the vote of the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors if the material facts of the transaction and the director’s interest were disclosed or known to the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors, or (II) if the material facts of the transactions and the director’s interest were disclosed or known to the members and they authorized, approved or ratified the transaction.  A conflict of interest transaction is so authorized, approved or ratified as follows:

(i) By Directors.

By the directors, if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors on the board of directors or on the committee who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction; provided that a transaction may not be so authorized, approved or ratified by a single director. If a majority of the directors who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction votes to authorize, approve or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking such action.  The presence of, or a vote cast by, a director with a direct or indirect interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of any action so taken hereunder if the transaction is otherwise approved as permitted under Section 65.361 of the Act.

(ii) By Members.

By the members, if it receives a majority of the votes entitled to be counted.  Votes cast by or voted under the control of a director who has a direct or indirect interest in the transaction, and votes cast by or voted under the control of an entity described in subsection (4) of Section 65.361 of the Act may be counted in a vote of members to determine whether to authorize, approve or ratify a conflict of interest transaction hereunder.  A majority of the members, whether or not present, that are entitled to be counted in a vote on the transaction hereunder constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking action hereunder.

(c) Additional Conflict of Interest Rules

The Board may establish a policy that contains additional rules, requirements, and procedures for resolving or avoiding conflicts of interest.

Section 5.16 – Resignation and Removal

(a) Resignation.

Any director may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Board of Members (As Directors), the Chair of the Board, or the Secretary of this corporation.  A resignation is effective when the notice is effective under Section 65.034 of the Act, unless the notice specifies a later effective date.  Once delivered, a notice of resignation is irrevocable unless permitted to be withdrawn by the Board of Members (As Directors) prior to its effectiveness.

(b) Removal for Cause.

The members may remove for cause, at a meeting called for that purpose, any director elected by the members who has been declared of unsound mind by a final order of court, or convicted of a felony, or found by a final order or judgment to have breached any duty arising under these Bylaws, the Articles or Section 65.357 of the Act.  Only the members of the class that elected such director may vote to remove such director, and the director may be removed only if the number of votes cast to remove the director would be sufficient to elect the director at a meeting to elect such director.  An At-Large Director may be removed with cause by the affirmative vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then in office.

(c) Removal without Cause.

Any director except an At-Large Director may be removed without cause at a meeting called for that purpose by the members of the class that elected such director.  Such director may be removed hereunder only if the number of votes cast to remove the director would be sufficient to elect the director at a meeting to elect such director.  An At-Large Director may be removed without cause by the affirmative vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then in office.

Observers shall in no event have the right to attend or participate in any executive session attended only by directors.

Except for adjustments that the Board shall make from time to time to maintain or create staggered terms upon any increase or decrease in the authorized number of directors, the term of office for Platinum Developers, Gold Developers, and the Silver Developer shall be two years; such term of office shall run from February 1 to January 31 of the second calendar year after election.  The Board shall make provisions to stagger the terms of the Gold Developers and the Silver Developer so that each year the terms of as close as possible to one-half of such directors shall expire.

Each director elected shall hold office until their successor is elected.  A vacancy or vacancies shall be deemed to exist (i) in the case of the death or the resignation or removal of any director pursuant to this Article IV, (ii) if the authorized number of directors is increased without election of the additional directors so provided for, (iii) in the case of failure at any time to elect the full number of authorized directors, (iv) automatically, upon the failure of a director to attend three (3) consecutive regularly scheduled Board meetings, or (v) as provided in the last sentence of this Section 5.4.

Notice of the time and place of each meeting of the Committee of Developers not fixed by an express provision of the Bylaws or by a standing resolution of the Committee of Developers shall be given to each director not less than two (2) days before the date of the meeting.  Such notice may be given personally or by telephone, telegraph, facsimile, electronic mail, or first-class mail.

Section 5.9 – Action without Meeting

(a) Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Committee of Developers under any provision of the Act may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board shall individually or collectively consent in writing to such action.  The action shall be evidenced by one or more written consents describing the action taken, signed by each director, and included in the minutes or filed with the corporate records reflecting the action taken.  Action taken hereunder is effective when the last director signs the consent, unless the consent specifies an earlier or later effective date.  A consent signed hereunder has the effect of a meeting vote and may be described as such in any document.

(b) On or after January 1, 2020, the corporation’s board of directors may, without a meeting, use email or other electronic means to take action that is required or permitted by the Act to be taken by the Committee of Developers at a meeting if the corporation complies with this Section 5.9(b). Before taking an action by email, a corporation shall send to the email address that each director provided to the corporation for receiving communications from the corporation an email announcement (“Announcement of Electronic Action”) that (i) states that the board of directors will take the action, (ii) includes a description of the matter on which the board of directors will take action, and (iii) specifies a deadline of not less than 48 hours after the time the corporation sends the announcement in which a director may record the director’s vote. The Announcement of Electronic Action and a record of the directors’ votes shall be included in the minutes for the directors’ meeting or shall otherwise be filed in documents that reflect the action that the board took. The board of directors may not use email or other electronic means to take action if the corporation does not have a record of an email address for a director. A director may change the director’s vote at any time before the deadline set forth in the Announcement of Electronic Action. An affirmative vote of the majority of the directors who hold office at the time the board of directors takes an action by means of email or by other electronic means is an act of the board. The board’s action described in this Section 5.9(c) has the effect of a meeting vote, and the corporation may describe the action as a meeting vote in any document. The board of directors’ action under this Section 5.9(c) is effective on the deadline specified in the Announcement of Electronic Action, unless the announcement specifies a different effective date or time. The board of directors may, without complying with all of the requirements of this Section 5.9(c), use electronic mail to discuss, but not take action on, an issue that comes before the board.

Section 5.10 – Telephonic Meetings

The Committee of Developers may permit any or all directors to participate in a regular or special meeting by, or conduct the meeting through, use of any means of communication by which all directors participating may simultaneously hear each other or otherwise communicate at substantially the same time with each other during the meeting and have access to materials necessary to participate or vote in the meeting to the extent of the person’s authorization to participate or vote. A director participating in a meeting by this means is deemed to be present in person at the meeting.

Section 5.11 – Quorum

Unless otherwise provided herein, fifty-percent of the directors then in office (but in no case fewer than one-third of the fixed or prescribed number of directors provided for in these Bylaws) shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business except adjournment.  Every act or decision done or made by a majority of the directors present at a meeting duly held at which a quorum is present shall be regarded as the act of the Committee of Developers unless a greater number is required by law, or by the Articles, or by these Bylaws.

Section 5.12 – Fees and Compensation

Developers may receive such compensation, if any, for their services and such reimbursement for expenses as may be fixed or determined by resolution of the Committee of Developers; provided that such compensation shall be reasonable and shall be comparable to that compensation paid by unaffiliated entities for a like position.  Nothing herein shall be considered to preclude any director from serving this corporation in any other capacity, including as an officer, agent, employee, consultant or otherwise, and receiving reasonable compensation therefor.

Section 5.13 – Indemnity

The corporation shall indemnify its directors to the fullest extent allowed or required by Sections 65.391 through 65.404 of the Act.

Section 5.14 – Standard of Conduct

Pursuant to Section 65.357 of the Act, a director shall discharge the duties of a director, including duties as a member of any committee of the Board upon which the director may serve, in good faith, with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances, and in a manner the director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation.  In discharging the duties of a director, a director shall be entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, in each case if prepared or presented by: (a) one or more officers or employees of this corporation whom the director reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented; (b) legal counsel, public accountants or other persons as to matters the director reasonably believes are within the person’s professional or expert competence; or (c) a committee of the Board of which the director is not a member, as to matters within the committee’s jurisdiction, if the director reasonably believes the committee merits confidence.  A director is not acting in good faith if the director has knowledge concerning the matter in question that makes reliance otherwise permitted in this Section 5.14 unwarranted.  A director is not liable to the corporation, any member or any other person for any action taken or not taken as a director, if the director acted in compliance with this Section 5.14.  The liability of a director for monetary damages to the corporation shall be eliminated to the fullest extent permitted by the Act.

Section 5.16 – Resignation and Removal

(a) Resignation.

Any director may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Committee of Developers, the Chair of the Board, or the Secretary of this corporation.  A resignation is effective when the notice is effective under Section 65.034 of the Act, unless the notice specifies a later effective date.  Once delivered, a notice of resignation is irrevocable unless permitted to be withdrawn by the Committee of Developers prior to its effectiveness.

(b) Removal for Cause.

The members may remove for cause, at a meeting called for that purpose, any director elected by the members who has been declared of unsound mind by a final order of court, or convicted of a felony, or found by a final order or judgment to have breached any duty arising under these Bylaws, the Articles or Section 65.357 of the Act.  Only the members of the class that elected such director may vote to remove such director, and the director may be removed only if the number of votes cast to remove the director would be sufficient to elect the director at a meeting to elect such director.  An At-Large Developer may be removed with cause by the affirmative vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then in office.

(c) Removal without Cause.

Any director except an At-Large Developer may be removed without cause at a meeting called for that purpose by the members of the class that elected such director.  Such director may be removed hereunder only if the number of votes cast to remove the director would be sufficient to elect the director at a meeting to elect such director.  An At-Large Developer may be removed without cause by the affirmative vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then in office.
