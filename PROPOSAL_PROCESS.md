# Proposal Process: A Comprehensive Guide

## Overview

The DAO structure is a comprehensive system designed to facilitate the development and implementation of ideas in the field of distributed ledger technology (DLT), specifically Xahau, Hooks, Rippled/Xrpld, and Github. The structure is divided into three main components: Ideas, Candidates, and Proposals. Each component plays a crucial role in the overall process, from the conception of an idea to its final implementation.

## Ideas

Ideas in the XLS structure is a crucial part of the overall process. It is the initial stage where concepts are born and gradually refined into actionable proposals. The flow of ideas is divided into three main stages: Request for Information (RFI), Request for Proposal (RFP), and Request for Quotations (RFQ) for creating a proposal.

### Request for Information (RFI)

The RFI stage is the birthplace of ideas. At this stage, a user has a concept or a question that they believe could lead to an improvement or innovation in the field of distributed ledger technology (DLT). However, they may not have a clear understanding of the technical aspects or feasibility of their idea. 

The RFI is a call to the community for more information. It's a way for the user to gather insights, feedback, and potential challenges related to their idea. The community can provide technical details, potential use cases, and even potential pitfalls or challenges that the idea might face.

### Request for Proposal (RFP)

Once the idea has been refined through the RFI stage, it moves on to the RFP stage. At this point, the user has a clearer understanding of their idea and its potential impact. They are now actively seeking a candidate who can transform this idea into a detailed proposal.

The RFP is a call to the community for candidates who are capable of creating a proposal out of the idea. It's a way for the user to find individuals or teams with the necessary technical knowledge and skills to bring their idea to life. The RFP stage also includes a crowdfunding aspect, where community members can donate to support the creation of the proposal.

### Request for Quotations (RFQ)

The final stage in the flow of ideas is the RFQ stage. Once a candidate has been identified and the crowdfunding goal has been reached, the RFQ is issued. This is a call for the candidate to provide a detailed quotation for creating the proposal.

The quotation should include a breakdown of the work involved, the resources required, and an estimate of the cost. This allows the community to understand the scope of the proposal and the resources needed to implement it. Once the quotation is accepted, the candidate can start working on the proposal, marking the transition from the idea stage to the proposal stage.

### Idea Persona

The idea persona in the XLS structure is someone who has a concept or idea for improvement in the field of distributed ledger technology (DLT). They may lack technical understanding but are crucial for initiating the process by seeking information and feedback from the community. They are open to learning and refining their idea, serving as the spark that ignites innovation in the XLS structure.

## Candidates

Candidates are the driving force behind the transformation of ideas into tangible proposals and their eventual implementation. They are individuals or groups who are deeply involved in the source code or implementation of distributed ledger technology (DLT). They possess a strong understanding of Xahau, Rippled/Xrpld, DLT, and Hooks, which equips them with the necessary knowledge and skills to navigate the complexities of the field.

### Role of Candidates

Candidates play a pivotal role in the XLS structure. Their responsibilities include:

1. **Understanding and Evaluating Ideas:** Candidates are expected to understand the ideas presented in the RFI or RFP stage. They evaluate the feasibility, potential impact, and technical requirements of these ideas.

2. **Proposal Creation:** If an idea is deemed viable, candidates are responsible for creating a detailed proposal. This proposal outlines the technical approach, timeline, and resources required to bring the idea to life.

3. **Crowdfunding Support:** Once the proposal is created and deployed on the DAO, candidates may assist in promoting the proposal to attract crowdfunding support.

4. **Implementation:** If the proposal is successfully funded and approved by the governance, candidates are responsible for implementing the proposal. This involves writing the necessary code, testing its functionality, and making necessary adjustments based on feedback.

5. **Review and Refinement:** Candidates also play a role in the review process. They are expected to mark their work for review once significant progress has been made. They then refine their work based on the feedback received during the review process.

6. **Final Implementation:** Once the proposal is reviewed and approved, candidates merge the proposal, marking the final implementation of the idea.

### Candidate Persona

The candidate persona is someone with a strong understanding of Xahau, Rippled/Xrpld, DLT, and Hooks. They are technically proficient, detail-oriented, and capable of transforming abstract ideas into concrete solutions. They are also collaborative, ready to engage with the community for feedback and improvements.

## Proposals

Proposals are the next step in the XLS structure. Technically, anyone can take an idea and create a proposal out of it, or just create a proposal without first creating an idea. Proposals are first created in the XLS discussion, and then the Transia DAO is used to crowdfund the proposal.

### Voting: Treasury-Funded Proposals

Proposals funded by the Treasury are subject to a voting process that involves different committees, each with its own focus and voting threshold. The committees and their respective voting thresholds are as follows:

1. **Executive Committee:** The Executive Committee decides on proposals with a voting threshold of 70% in favor and 30% against. This committee typically handles high-level decisions that affect the overall direction and strategy of the DAO.

2. **Investment Committee:** The Investment Committee makes decisions on proposals with a 70/30 voting threshold. This committee focuses on proposals that involve financial investments or asset management within the DAO.

3. **Marketing Committee:** The Marketing Committee's decisions are made by the community with a 50/50 voting threshold. This committee is responsible for proposals related to marketing initiatives, outreach, and community engagement.

4. **Development Committee:** The Development Committee decides on proposals with a 70/30 voting threshold. This committee is tasked with overseeing proposals that pertain to the technical development and improvement of the DAO's infrastructure and projects.

### Donation: Community-Funded Proposals

Proposals funded by community donations follow a different process. Community members can contribute directly to proposals they support, and the success of these proposals is determined by the amount of funding they receive from the community. This pathway allows for a more grassroots approach to funding, where the community's willingness to donate reflects the proposal's popularity and perceived value.

### Proposal Flow

1. **Idea Creation (RFI or RFP):** The process begins with the creation of an idea, which can either be a Request for Information (RFI) or a Request for Proposal (RFP).

2. **XLS Github Proposal Creation:** The idea is turned into a proposal on Github, where it is open for discussion and refinement.

3. **DAO Proposal Creation/Deployment:** The refined proposal is created and deployed on the DAO, where it will be funded either by Voting (Treasury) or Donation (Community).

    - **Voting (Treasury):** The proposal is subject to a vote by the relevant committee or the community, depending on the nature of the proposal. The voting thresholds of 70/30 or 50/50 must be met for the proposal to be funded.
    - **Donation (Community):** The community can donate to the proposal. If the proposal reaches its funding goal before the expiration date, it moves on to the next step. If it doesn't reach its goal, the money is returned to the donors.

4. **Funding Goal Reached & Request for Quotations (RFQ):** Once the funding goal is reached, an RFQ is issued for developers or teams to submit their quotations.

5. **Governance Votes on Developer/Quote:** The governance votes on the developer or quote, and the chosen party begins work on the proposal.

6. **Developer Marks for Review:** The developer or team marks the proposal for review after significant progress.

7. **Review Process:** The proposal undergoes multiple reviews to ensure proper implementation.

8. **Merged & Final Payouts Disbursed:** Once approved, the proposal is merged, and final payouts are disbursed.
